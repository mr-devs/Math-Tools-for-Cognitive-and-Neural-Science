# Math-Tools-for-Cognitive-and-Neural-Science
This repository is a collection of the lab code/notes provided to students during this course as well as code created by me for assignments throughout the semester.

# Description 
A graduate lecture course covering mathematical and computational tools necessary to solve data analysis and modeling problems, the transformations of
raw data into a form in which these tools may be utilized, and the interpretation of such analyses. Lectures on each topic will include some mathematical background, derivation of basic results, and examples relevant to neural
science. The course will include weekly problem sets based on the MATLAB
software package

# Format:
The course consists of two 2-hour lectures per week, and a computer lab session
roughly every other week. The course includes a sequence of 5-6 homework assignments, primarily in the form of computer exercises, to examine the lecture topics in the context of concrete and realistic problems. These are essential for
learning the material. Grades are based primarily on homework, but also take
into account attendance and participation.

# Materials:
There is no textbook. Supplementary reading materials will be handed out in
class. All materials will be available from the course web site: http://www.cns.nyu.edu/âˆ¼eero/math-tools/

# Topics:
**I. Linear Algebra & Least Squares (4 weeks)**: 
- vector spaces, projection, matrices, singular value decomposition, least-squares regression, Principal Components Analysis, total-least-squares regression, linear discriminants.

**II. Linear Systems Theory (4 weeks)**:
- Convolution and Fourier Transforms (1D and multi-D), sampling, aliasing and the Nyquist theorem.

**III. Probability & Statistical inference (5 weeks)**: 
- Basic probability, summary statistics, parameter estimation, significance tests, model comparison, decision
theory, model fitting, comparison, and selection.
