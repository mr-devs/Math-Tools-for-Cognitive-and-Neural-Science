%% Math Tools I - HW #1 - Question 1

% Purpose: This code has been written to wrestle with question 1 of the
% first homework of math tools I.

% Author: Matthew DeVerna

% Date: 09/24/19

%% Question 1: Determine if a system is linear. 
% If it is, create a matrix which satsifiys the input/output pairs.

% In order for a system to be linear it must meet the requirements of
% superposition: homogeneity and additivity. More simply, any type of linear
% combination to the inputs should have the same effect on the
% outputs.
    
%% Question 1: System 1:

input1 = 1          ;
input2 = 2.5        ;
output1 = [4;6]     ;
output2 = [10;14]   ;

% Because scaling input1 by 2.5 gives input2 exactly, the same affect
% should be seen for the outputs - if the system is linear.

if input1 * 2.5 == input2                           % Set conditional if-statement
    disp('Input 1 * 2.5 equals Input 2')            % If the condition is accurate, print this.

else
    disp('Input 1 * 2.5 DOES NOT equal Input 2')    % If the condition is NOT accurate, print this.
end

% Lets try the same for the outputs...


if output1 * 2.5 == output2                         % Set conditional if-statement
    disp('Output 1 * 2.5 equals Output 2')          % If the condition is accurate, print this.
else

end

%% Question 1: System 2:

%{
Since the scope of this question's programming complexity is quite simple,
I will use the same variables as we move through the rest of this problem. 
The linear nature of this script allows me to do so without worrying about 
workspace/variable issues - and offers the benefit of simple, clear and
understandable variables.

%% Question 1: System 4

input1 = [2 ; 4];
input2 = [-2; 1];
output1 = 0 ;
output2 = 3 ;

%{ 
We can determine the values of the 2-by-1 vector that is the linear system.
The shape of the system is determined by the shape of the input and output.

Input   REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH>  System REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH>  Output
(1 x 2) REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> (2 x 1) REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH (1 x 1)
REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> Take the "outer elements" of the matrix shapes to form the end result.

We can determine this vector's values through the elimination method of
solving linear equations:

[2 ; 4] REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH>  0 
[-2; 1] REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH>  3    can be written as:

2x + 4y = 0    and
-2x + y = 3
|REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> Because the linear system's effect is equivalent to the dot product.

Then, combining these equations into one gives you:

5y = 3

Solving for y gives you REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> y = .6 or (3/5)

Plug in .6 to one of the equations and solve for x...

2x + 4(3/5) = 0
2x + 2.4    = 0
2x          = -2.4
x           = -1.2

Based on this solution, it looks as though these input/output pairs create
a linear system which should successfully operate on our pairs in a
predictable manner - such that we get the predicted output pairs.

Lets see if we can test this below in the same manner as earlier problems...
%}

% Create our test vector...
testVec = [-1.2,.6] ;


if (testVec * input1) == output1                                            % Set conditional if-statement
    disp('The dot product of testVec and Input1 equals Output1')            % If the condition is accurate, print this.

else
    disp('The dot product of testVec and Input1 DOES NOT equals Output1')   % If the condition is NOT accurate, print this.
end

% Lets try the same for the input2 and output2...

else
    disp('The dot product of testVec and Input2 DOES NOT equals Output2')   % If the condition is NOT accurate, print this.
end

answer = [('By testing the matrix that we found, we can see this system is linear')]

% Furthermore, we can scale these inputs and feed them into the system to
% further verify them.

if (testVec * (3*input1)) == 3*output1                                            % Set conditional if-statement
    disp('The dot product of testVec and Input1 (scaled by 3) equals Output1')            % If the condition is accurate, print this.

else
    disp('The dot product of testVec and Input1 (scaled by 3) DOES NOT equals Output1')   % If the condition is NOT accurate, print this.
end

% Lets try the same for the input2 and output2...

    (' the linear system that we found - this system still holds up to the laws of superposition.')]
